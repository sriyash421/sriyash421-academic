abstract: "Since its outbreak, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has
caused unprecedented losses to human lives and economies around the
world. As of 30th October 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO)
has reported more than 44 million confirmed cases including close to
1.1 million deaths across 216 countries and territories. As majority of
the world’s population continues to be affected by fear and anxiety and
thus remain confined to their homes, more and more people have started
relying on social media platforms such as Twitter for expressing their
feelings and attitudes towards various aspects of the pandemic. With
rising concerns of mental well-being, it becomes imperative to analyze
the dynamics of public affect in order to anticipate any potential threats
and take precautionary measures. Since affective states of human mind
are more nuanced than meager binary sentiments, here we propose a deep
learning-based system to identify people’s emotions from their tweets. We
achieve competitive results on two benchmark datasets for multi-label
emotion classification. We then use our system to analyze and contrast
the evolution of emotional responses among Indians and Britons as the
pandemic continues to spread its wings. We also study the development
of salient factors contributing towards the changes in attitudes over time.
Finally, we discuss directions to further improve our work and hope that
our analysis can lay foundation for further research and better public
health monitoring."
